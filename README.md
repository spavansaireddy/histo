Here Frequency of each word means how many times the word is repeated in the given text file.

Ex: In these file the word "I" was repeated 21 times in the text file, then the frequency of word occurrence is 21.

The application will show a histogram of the 20 most often occuring words on the frontend. The X-axis will display the top 20 words with the highest frequency of occurrence, and the Y-axis will display the frequency of each word in the text file. The user will be able to see the frequency of word distribution in the text by using the histogram.
